# Automation Exercise (using Selenium)
- This is the same project as (https://github.com/mmostafa886/AutomationExercise) but this one is using the native Selenium
- to open the report directly after the execution , use the commands `mvn clean test -Dtest=ApiTest && ./generate_allure_report.sh
`
- The file `.github/dependabot.yml` was added to allow the dependabot to check for dependency updates so that we can keep all the pom.xml dependencies updated
